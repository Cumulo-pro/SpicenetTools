# Spicenet Consensus System Metrics Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed reference for the metrics used in the **Spicenet** consensus system. These metrics, collected through **Prometheus**, are essential for monitoring the performance, security, and health of the nodes in the network.

The document is structured into different metric categories, including **HTTP request latency**, **total processed requests**, **batch operation performance**, and **response sizes**. Each metric is described with its meaning, value interpretation, and example data.

By leveraging these metrics, network operators and developers can ensure optimal performance, detect potential issues, and maintain a secure and efficient blockchain environment.

For ease of navigation, please refer to the **Table of Contents** below.

## HTTP REQUEST LATENCY
### Metric: `prometheus_exporter_request_duration_seconds`

**Description:**  
The **HTTP Request Latency Metric** measures the time taken for HTTP requests to be processed by the Prometheus exporter. This metric is recorded as a **histogram**, allowing for the analysis of response time distribution across different time intervals.  

Tracking request latency is crucial for identifying performance bottlenecks, ensuring system responsiveness, and diagnosing potential delays in HTTP request handling.  

**Value Interpretation:**  
Each bucket represents the number of requests that were processed within the specified duration threshold.  

| Latency Threshold | Request Count |
|------------------|--------------|
| `≤ 0.005s`      | 4 requests   |
| `≤ 0.01s`       | 4 requests   |
| `≤ 0.025s`      | 4 requests   |
| `≤ 0.05s`       | 4 requests   |
| `≤ 0.1s`        | 4 requests   |
| `≤ 0.25s`       | 4 requests   |
| `≤ 0.5s`        | 4 requests   |
| `≤ 1s`          | 4 requests   |
| `≤ 2.5s`        | 4 requests   |
| `≤ 5s`          | 4 requests   |
| `≤ 10s`         | 4 requests   |
| `+Inf`          | 4 requests   |

- **Total Latency Time:** `0.000004638` seconds.  
- **Total Number of Requests:** `4`.  

Monitoring this metric helps optimize system performance by reducing high-latency responses and ensuring that request processing remains efficient.

## TOTAL HTTP REQUESTS
### Metric: `prometheus_exporter_requests_total`

**Description:**  
The **Total HTTP Requests Metric** records the **total number of HTTP requests** received by the Prometheus exporter. This metric is a **counter**, meaning it only increases over time, reflecting the cumulative number of requests processed since the exporter started running.  

Tracking this metric is essential for monitoring service demand, detecting unusual request spikes, and ensuring that the system can handle incoming traffic efficiently.

**Value Interpretation:**  
- **Each increment** in this counter represents a new processed request.
- **The absolute value** of this metric indicates the total number of requests since data collection started.

**Example Value:**  
- **Total Requests Received:** `4`

By monitoring this metric, operators can track system load, optimize resource allocation, and detect potential issues such as traffic surges or service disruptions.

## HTTP RESPONSE SIZE
### Metric: `prometheus_exporter_response_size_bytes`

**Description:**  
The **HTTP Response Size Metric** measures the size of the **HTTP response** generated by the Prometheus exporter, recorded in **bytes**. This metric is a **gauge**, meaning it can increase or decrease over time, reflecting changes in response payload size.  

Tracking this metric is important for optimizing resource usage, identifying unusually large responses, and ensuring efficient communication between Prometheus and its clients.

**Value Interpretation:**  
- **Higher values** may indicate that Prometheus is returning more data than usual, potentially leading to increased network and memory usage.
- **Consistently high values** may suggest the need for query optimization or data reduction.

**Example Value:**  
- **Current Response Size:** `37,821` bytes.

By monitoring this metric, system operators can detect inefficient queries, optimize response payloads, and maintain a well-performing Prometheus instance.
